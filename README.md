> Could use help to create different language versions. PR please!
* Automatically store your progess locally so remember to come back and update your progress!
* Tap background to randomly change bg color

## Diary

There is a short post related to this project in my 
[blog](https://tenpages.github.io/dev/2022/10/24/level/).

## Disclaimer

Countries potrayed in the maps are highly abstracted. Only major parts of countries are illustrated. For the European version, only sovereign countries with recognition from overwhelming majority of other countries in the world (as of 2022-10-25) are included.

Definitions of levels are deliberately not specified. Please use at your own discretion. I'd only suggest "higher the points, higher the 'involvements' you have for that place".

Please feel free to create other versions using this code, so long as they are released under the same license. I do not have future plans on creating new versions, as my knowledge in other regions might not be sufficient for me to do so.

## Fonts and settings

`html/slice.woff` is built from Noto Sans by Google Fonts. 

`generate-font-slice.js` contains legacy files and configs from `china-ex` repository.
